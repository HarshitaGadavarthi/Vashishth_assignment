Imagine you are coming to the busy city Mumbai for the first time and you arrive by plane. Exiting the airport is easy - you simply follow the exit signs and then you grab a taxi. 

After enjoying a week of exploring the sights and Maharashtrian food it is time for you to take your flight back home. Navigating through the airport and ensuring you have all the necessary documents is a bit trickier now compared to when you arrived. 

You know what terminal you are flying from but you have no idea how to find your way to where you need to drop your suitcase off, which security check is the right and emptiest one for you or which gate your flight will depart from. Additionally, what documents do they need for you to fly safely in Corona times? 

â†’ All these questions and one app to give you an answer to them: NamasteWings

NamasteWings is an app that helps you find your way around the airport as easily as possible and only needs your flight number and date to do so. Also, it knows what documents are needed and provides a neat space for you to keep them all ready to show to the airport staff.
