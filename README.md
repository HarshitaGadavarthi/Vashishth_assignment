Subject: Correction in Nomination Form for UI/UX Graphic Design Internship

Dear Sir/Madam,
I hope this message finds you well. I recently realized a misunderstanding in my Nomination Form for the UI/UX Graphic Design Internship. I inadvertently marked the second preference as my first as it was written as preference 2 on the form.I kindly request your consideration in reviewing my application for the UI/UX Graphic Design Internship, as my passion and skills align closely with the role.Thank you for your understanding.

Yours truly,
[Sri Sai Harshita Gadavarthi]
